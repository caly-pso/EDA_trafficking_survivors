Human trafficking can happen anywhere, and predominatly affects children and young adults. This is a difficult statistic to track, as getting help to those entraped by human trafficking is difficult, and keeping their information safe once they become surviors is imperative. The [Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/) has created a international platform where individual organizations are able to upload their tracking data of survivors. As this only tracks those who have been able to escape trafficking, we can assume the number of individuales trafficking affects is much larger. Using this data however, we can get a glimps of who is affected, and how, leading to better strategies of breaking the cycle as a whole.
