# EDA of Human Trafficking Survivors Project!

### How to Run:

To run my projects, simply click human_trafficking_survivors.ipynb and GitHub will load the Jupyter file. The CSV I used is also avalible above. (sometimes GitHub is finicky with Jupyter, if so, the project can also be loaded at: https://caly-pso.github.io/human_trafficking_survivors.html

## An Exploration of Survivors

### Goal:

To use data analysis to gain insight on the scope of human trafficking survivors, as well as the limitations the data provides.

### Software Used:

- Jupyter Notebook

### Languages Used:

- Python

### Packages Used:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- GeoPandas

### Open Data From:

- The [Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/)

## Introduction:

Human trafficking can happen anywhere, and predominatly affects children and young adults. This is a difficult statistic to track, as getting help to those entraped by human trafficking is difficult, and keeping their information safe once they become surviors is imperative. The [Counter-Trafficking Data Collaborative](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/) has created a international platform where individual organizations are able to upload their tracking data of survivors. As this only tracks those who have been able to escape trafficking, we can assume the number of individuales trafficking affects is much larger. Using this data however, we can get a glimps of who is affected, and how, leading to better strategies of breaking the cycle as a whole.
